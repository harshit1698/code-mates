So one fine day Himadri (DAIICT- M.Tech Final Year) and I decided to start solving DS problems by becoming code-buddies.
As code-buddies we designed a challenge! 

The challenge is to solve 5 DS problems daily and either of the one who misses to solve a problem will pay the other person Rs.50/problem missed as penalty.

The link of the problems is : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/must-do-1/

If you're joning the challenge, following are the next steps:

	- Fork this repo to your GitHub Account

	- Make a subdirectory with your name under the directory for the particular data-structure and put your codes in that directory
	  e.g.	├── Array
		│   ├── Himadri
		│   │   ├── binary_search.cpp
		│   │   ├── equilibrium_point.c
		│   └── Mritunjay
		│       ├── binarySearch.cpp
		│       ├── boolMatrix.cpp

	- Once you are done with your 5 problems of the day, push your code to your forked repo and then creat a pull request to the original repo.


Happy coding :)
