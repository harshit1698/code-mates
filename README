So one fine day Himadri (DAIICT- M.Tech Final Year) and I decided to start solving DS problems by becoming code-buddies.
As code-buddies we designed a challenge! 

The challenge is to solve 5 DS problems daily and either of the one who misses to solve a problem will pay the other person Rs.50/problem missed as penalty.

The link of the problems is : https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/batch/must-do-1/
